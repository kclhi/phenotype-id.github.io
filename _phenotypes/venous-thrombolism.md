### Primary Care

In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, primary care data) we ascertained {{ page.name }} cases by searching for Read terms related to an {{ page.name }} diagnosis or evidence of endovascular/transluminal procedures related to the emergency repair of an aneurysmal segment of the aorta.

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.primary_care.CPRD_vte_ex_pe %}

Read terms are hierarhically organized in top-level chapters i.e. chapter G....00 is related to Circulatory System Diseases and sub-headings i.e. heading G2...00 is related to Hypertensive Heart Disease while G3...00 is related to Ischaemic Heart Disease.

### Secondary Care

In Hospital Episode Statistics (HES, hospital admission data) we used ICD-10 terms (see below) for {{ page.name }} diagnosis when marked as the primary diagnosis i.e. the main condition treated or investigated during the relevant episode of healthcare. We used the date of admission to hospital as the date of the event. We additionally searched for OPCS-4 terms indicating the emergency repair of an aneurysmal segment of the aorta.

### Death

### Implementation

**Combining evidence across sources to define and date phenotypes**

<pre>
At the specified date, a patient is defined as having had Venous thromboembolic disease (Excl PE) IF they meet the criteria for any of the following on or before the specified date. The earliest date on which the individual meets any of the following criteria on or before the specified date is defined as the first event date:

Primary care
1. Venous thromboembolic disease (Excl PE) diagnosis or history of diagnosis during a consultation 
OR
Secondary care (ICD10)
1. ALL diagnoses of Venous thromboembolic disease (Excl PE) or history of diagnosis during a hospitalization
